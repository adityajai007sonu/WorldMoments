A better / upgraded version of this app is [Here](https://github.com/hughred22/Ionic2-Angular2-YouTube-Channel-App) 
It is rebuilt from ground up with Ionic 2 with more features. Check it out now. I won't actively update this repo anymore as Ionic 1 version is retired.

# YouTube Video Listing Ionic Mobile App

A hybrid mobile app build with Ionic Framework, AngularJS and YouTube API V3. I also added code to get data from WordPress using WP REST API: http://wp-api.org/

This is a single view hybrid mobile app that built with Ionic Framework to demo how easy to get data from YouTube API V3, to use ionic infinite scroll to get paginated YouTube data and display YouTube video using third party library. 

To use this example code, first make sure you have node js, Cordova and Ionic command-line tools install. Then start a blank Ionic App like so:

`$ ionic start youtubevideo blank`

Then replace everything inside your www folder with the files you downloaded from here. 

Fork it, comment and let me know how you want to improve this app. Thank you for checking it out.
